Solarized Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal
========================================

Scripts for setting the Solarized color set with Gnome Terminal. Scripts by
Sigurd Gartmann <sigurdga@sigurdga.no>, based on colors by Ethan Schoonover
<es@ethanschoonover.com>.

Notes about color settings in Gnome Terminal
--------------------------------------------

In Gnome terminal there are built-in color profiles, but these are hardcoded
and we cannot change or add these profiles. These scripts are setting a few
gconf parameters that will set the palette colors, foreground, background and
highlight colors to either a light or dark color scheme.

Only the foreground, background and highlight colors are different in the light
and dark color sets, as one of the main ideas behind Ethan Schonoovers work is
to use the same colors in the palette for both.

Visit the [Solarized homepage]
------------------------------

See the [Solarized homepage] for theory behind the colors, screenshots, details
and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
applications.

The colors for Gnome Terminal is maintained in [Gnome Terminal Colors Solarized
repository].

Installation and usage
----------------------

Clone the [git repository], create a new profile from gnome-terminal Menu, say
"Solarized", and then run one of the scripts: set_light.sh or set_dark.sh.

    $ git clone git://github.com/sigurdga/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
    $ ./set_light.sh
    $ ./set_dark.sh

Of course, you only need to run one of the scripts. See the [Solarized
homepage] for screenshots which will help you select either the light or dark
background.

Specifying the profile to change
--------------------------------

And you can run them with a parameter, telling it which profile to modify. To
change another profile than the last created profile, this profile need to exist before you
run the command. Now, at this point, it is not as easy as it should be, as the
profile you create in the terminal have another name on disk; the first
one will be called Profile0, the second Profile1, etc.
