Solarized Colorscheme for Gnome Terminal
========================================

Scripts for setting the Solarized color set with Gnome Terminal.

Colors
------

Only the foreground, background and highlight colors are different in the light
and dark color sets, as one of the main ideas behind Ethan Schonoovers work is
to use the same colors in the palette for both.

If you are not happy, you can change which colors are used for what in the
shell. This can be done by using [ls-colors-solarized].

See the [Solarized homepage] for theory behind the colors, screenshots, details
and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
applications.

The scripts for Gnome Terminal is maintained in [Gnome Terminal Colors
Solarized repository].

Clone the [git repository], then run `./solarize`. To change between light and
dark background, run `./solarize` again.

    $ cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
    $ ./solarize

Uninstall
---------
